/**
 * The ONE frame decoder for both demo clients.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no DOM, no ANSI, no `node:` import. It is imported unchanged by
 * `cli.ts` (bun) and by `web/app.ts` (bundled for a browser by `serve.ts`), so
 * the two surfaces cannot drift in their reading of the wire. What it does NOT
 * do is decide how a colour or an attribute is PAINTED — `cli.ts` turns the
 * classification below into SGR and `app.ts` turns it into CSS, because that is
 * surface, not protocol.
 *
 * The wire shape is `protocol/frame.go`, and three of its rules are the whole
 * of this file:
 *
 *   1. A frame is WHOLE ROWS. `key:true` means `lines` covers every row and the
 *      client clears first; `key:false` means each line REPLACES the row it
 *      names. So deltas merge by row index and a gap in `seq` is harmless.
 *   2. Run columns are CELL columns, not indexes into `t`. A double-width
 *      glyph is one code point in two cells, and `wd` lists the code-point
 *      indexes that are wide. A client that painted by code point would drift
 *      one column right of every CJK glyph on the line.
 *   3. `t` is right-trimmed and the runs are NOT. A run may extend past the end
 *      of the text — that is how a styled blank (a selection, a filled status
 *      bar) survives the trim.
 *
 * A frame with no `lines` at all is legitimate and must not be discarded: a
 * moved or hidden cursor, a scrollback change and an alt-screen switch all
 * change what a client draws without changing a cell.

 *

 * reflows whenever the human drags the window — which in a demo is the most
 * likely thing anyone does — and `FrameHeader` carries `rows` and `cols` on
 * every frame for exactly that reason. A resize and an alt-screen switch are
 * therefore treated as keyframes here even if `key` is false: magmux forces one
